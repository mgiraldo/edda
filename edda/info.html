		<p><br /><br /><span>Edda&trade;</span> connects with you with someone else (a lover or stranger) living far, far away. This app is a bit like a tunnel that we&rsquo;ve dug for the two of you to reach one another. We help you to recognize and embrace the distance that keeps the two of you apart, while making this virtual connection a bit more human. This means aligning your body with someone else and holding your gaze straight to their eyes, like an offline conversation.
